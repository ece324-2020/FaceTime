## Build

`cd env/`

Start the virtual environment: `source bin/activate`

If any dependancies are not installed run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

if you add more dependancies run: `pip freeze > requirements.txt` 

Once you're finished working with the virtual env run: `deactivate`

## Run

1. In `facerecon-system.py` change the frame-rate to the desired fps to pull frames (default every 0.5s)
2. In `run.sh` enter the desired time-stamps of the video you would like to process
3. Modify `run.sh` with the video you would like to process
4. Make a new folder called crop `New Folder` > `crop`
5. `./run.sh` to run the cropper and wait as it fills your new crop folder
